# EXPERIMENT-4 | Dwayne Pendilla | 2ECE-C
## ****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ****************** 
Experiment 4 focuses on the application of the Data Wrangling and Data Visualization. This experiment aims to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using libraries for Data Wrangling and Visualization.

### This experiment is comprised of only 1 problem:
(1) ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM - where I used the file "board2.csv" and uploaded its data into a data frame using pandas, and performed Data Wrangling and Visualization techniques.

## ********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
 *For Number 1,*

-- > First, I uploaded the data of the "board2.csv" file into the data frame "df"

-- > I then got the first and last 5 rows of the data frame using the functions "cars.head()" and "cars.tail()"
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*For Problem 2,*

-- > Utilizing the data frame "cars" from Problem 1, I performed the required operations on the data frame.

-- > (a.) display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.

-- > (b.) Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’

-- > (c.) How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?

-- > (d.) Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

## ********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************

*After conducting this experiment, I learned to:*

(a.) to identify and apply different codes and functions from the Pandas Library

(b.) to be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library.
