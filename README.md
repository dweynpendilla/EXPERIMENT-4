# EXPERIMENT-4 | Dwayne Pendilla | 2ECE-C
## ****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ****************** 
Experiment 4 focuses on the application of the Data Wrangling and Data Visualization. This experiment aims to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using libraries for Data Wrangling and Visualization.

### This experiment is comprised of only 1 problem:
(1) ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM - where I used the file "board2.csv" and uploaded its data into a data frame using pandas, and performed Data Wrangling and Visualization techniques.

## ********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
 *For Number 1,*

-- > First, I uploaded the data of the "board2.csv" file into the data frame "df"

-- > I then created 2 data frames with different parameters for each data frame:

-- > (a.) For the first data frame, named "Instru", the constants were the track as "Instrumentation" and hometown as "Luzon" and the variables displayed were the "Name", "GEAS", and "Electronics"

-- > (b.) For the second data frame, named "Mindy", the constants were the gemder as "Female" and hometown as "Mindanao" and the variables displayed were the "Name", "Track", "Electronics", and "Average"
> For the average, I computed the Average of the grades from all subjects

*For Problem 2,*

-- > Utilizing the data frame "board2" from Problem 1, I generated a bar graph showing the relation of the features to the average obtained by the students.

## ********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************

*After conducting this experiment, I learned to:*

(a.) to identify different codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data

(b.) to apply and use  the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization
